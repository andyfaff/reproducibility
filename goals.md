# Goals 

Some goals to be achieved by June 2020.

- Webpages (most likely on reflectivity.github.io) for the working group
- Information explaining what reproducibility is, and why it's important, and how it can be achieved for NR/XRR
- A list of papers that can be considered reproducible (moving towards goal-standard)
- Advertisement of Round Robin
- Poster submission to advertise the WG at SXSN16
